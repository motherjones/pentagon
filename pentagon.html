		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>To hear the Pentagon brass and their allies describe it, the nation is facing a grave new security threat: sequestration. Under the automatic budget cuts that kicked in last March, the Pentagon must trim nearly $1 trillion over the next decade—cuts originally intended to be so unpalatable as to force Congress to make a lasting budget deal. That didn't work out, but now congressional hawks, defense officials, and weapons contractors are warning that if the cuts aren't eliminated, America's military superiority will be.<p>

			<h1>The Missing Piece Dividend</h1>
			<p>Defense spending (in billions of 2013 dollars) dropped sharply after earlier conflicts. But perhaps not this time.</p>

		<p>But before you plan a bake sale to help the Pentagon pay its bills (or draw up your wish list for spending that new peace dividend), consider this: Even after the sequester, the Pentagon's base budget is set to remain well above pre-9/11 levels for the next decade, and the military is taking a far smaller haircut than it did after Vietnam and the Cold War wound down. "These 'terrible' cuts would return us to historically high levels of spending," snaps Winslow Wheeler of the Project on Government Oversight. Even if the sequester were to be scrapped, the Pentagon could reduce its budget by $100 billion a year without undermining its readiness, according to Lawrence J. Korb, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress.</p>
		<p>Facing $37 billion in cuts in 2013, the Pentagon furloughed contractors, delayed contracts, and grounded planes. But sequestration doesn't touch overseas operations—i.e., wars—soldiers' pay or benefits, veterans' benefits, or the nuclear arsenal. With another $52 billion set to be sliced, reversing those cuts has become the centerpiece of talk of a "grand bargain" to end the cycle of budget crises and fiscal hostage-taking.</p>
		<p>Republicans have proposed increasing defense spending and taking more money from Obamacare and other social programs, while Democrats have said they'd scale back the defense cuts in exchange for additional tax revenue.</p>
		<p>Both ideas are likely nonstarters, which means that after the next rounds of budget theater are over, sequestration may remain as the blunt, imperfect tool that forces the military to shed some of the bulk it acquired while fighting two of the longest and most expensive wars in our history. Deprived of its blank check, the Pentagon might heed the hawkish Capitol Hill insider who once called for the "bloated" defense establishment to "be pared down" and retooled for the 21st century. That insider? Vietnam vet and retired Republican senator from Nebraska Chuck Hagel, before he became secretary of defense.</p>
