		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>To hear the Pentagon brass and their allies describe it, the nation is facing a grave new security threat: sequestration. Under the automatic budget cuts that kicked in last March, the Pentagon must trim nearly $1 trillion over the next decade—cuts originally intended to be so unpalatable as to force Congress to make a lasting budget deal. That didn't work out, but now congressional hawks, defense officials, and weapons contractors are warning that if the cuts aren't eliminated, America's military superiority will be.<p>

		</section>
		<p>But before you plan a bake sale to help the Pentagon pay its bills (or draw up your wish list for spending that new peace dividend), consider this: Even after the sequester, the Pentagon's base budget is set to remain well above pre-9/11 levels for the next decade, and the military is taking a far smaller haircut than it did after Vietnam and the Cold War wound down. "These 'terrible' cuts would return us to historically high levels of spending," snaps Winslow Wheeler of the Project on Government Oversight. Even if the sequester were to be scrapped, the Pentagon could reduce its budget by $100 billion a year without undermining its readiness, according to Lawrence J. Korb, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress.</p>
		<p>Facing $37 billion in cuts in 2013, the Pentagon furloughed contractors, delayed contracts, and grounded planes. But sequestration doesn't touch overseas operations—i.e., wars—soldiers' pay or benefits, veterans' benefits, or the nuclear arsenal. With another $52 billion set to be sliced, reversing those cuts has become the centerpiece of talk of a "grand bargain" to end the cycle of budget crises and fiscal hostage-taking.</p>
		<p>Republicans have proposed increasing defense spending and taking more money from Obamacare and other social programs, while Democrats have said they'd scale back the defense cuts in exchange for additional tax revenue.</p>
		<p>Both ideas are likely nonstarters, which means that after the next rounds of budget theater are over, sequestration may remain as the blunt, imperfect tool that forces the military to shed some of the bulk it acquired while fighting two of the longest and most expensive wars in our history. Deprived of its blank check, the Pentagon might heed the hawkish Capitol Hill insider who once called for the "bloated" defense establishment to "be pared down" and retooled for the 21st century. That insider? Vietnam vet and retired Republican senator from Nebraska Chuck Hagel, before he became secretary of defense.</p>

		<h3>One out of every five tax dollars is spent on defense.</h3>
		<p>The $3.7 trillion federal budget breaks down into mandatory spending—benefits guaranteed the American people, such as Social Security and Medicare—and discretionary spending—programs that, at least in theory, can be cut. In 2013, more than half of all discretionary spending (and one-fifth of total spending) went to defense, including the Pentagon, veterans' benefits, and the nuclear weapons arsenal.<p>

		<h3>We're the world's 800-pound gorilla.</h3>

		<p>When it comes to defense spending, no country can compete directly with the United States, which spends more than the next 10 countries combined—including potential rivals Russia and China, as well as allies such as England, Japan, and France. Altogether, the Pentagon accounts for nearly 40 percent of global military spending. In 2012, 4.4 percent of our gdp went to defense. That's in line with how much Russia spends; China spends 2 percent of its gdp on its military.<p>

		<h3>We paid for two wars with credit.</h3>
		<p>As the Pentagon scrambles to find a trillion dollars in cuts, here's a quick reality check: The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan cost $1.5 trillion, about twice the cost of the Vietnam War in inflation-adjusted dollars. And that's just the "supplemental" military spending passed by Congress for the wars—the regular Pentagon budget also grew nearly 45 percent between 2001 and 2010. The main budget proposals in Washington would only bring the Pentagon's base (nonwar) budget down to around 2008 levels.</p>

		<p>The funds to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan came entirely from borrowing, contributing nearly 20 percent to the national debt accrued between 2001 and 2012. And there's more to come: Between paying down those obligations and caring for vets, economists Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes estimate that the wars' overall costs will top $4 trillion.<p>

		<h3>The wartime wage gap</h3>
		<section class="floatLeft">
			<img src="https://www.motherjones.com/files/us-chickens-capita.jpg" alt="" />
		</section>
		<p>About three-quarters of the Pentagon's budget goes to hardware, contractors, and operations, with the rest spent on the troops. But while the number of Americans in uniform increased 3 percent during the past decade, the annual cost per person doubled, to around $115,000. Congress approved multiple raises during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, but a look at base pay rates (what soldiers earn before add-ons like housing allowances and combat pay) shows that the wartime wages didn't trickle down the chain of command. Some of that can be explained by "brass creep"—the swelling ranks of generals and admirals who earn high salaries and retire with cushy pensions.</p>

		<h3>Where does the Pentagon's money go?</h3>
			<img src="https://www.motherjones.com/files/us-chickens-capita.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>The exact answer is a mystery. That's because the Pentagon's books are a complete mess. They're so bad that they can't even be officially inspected, despite a 1997 requirement that federal agencies submit to annual audits—just like every other business or organization.</p>
		<p>The Defense Department is one of just two agencies (Homeland Security is the other) that are keeping the bean counters waiting: As the Government Accountability Office dryly notes, the Pentagon has "serious financial management problems" that make its financial statements "inauditable." Pentagon financial operations occupy one-fifth of the gao's list of federal programs with a high risk of waste, fraud, or inefficiency.</p>
		<p>Critics also contend that the Pentagon cooks its books by using unorthodox accounting methods that make its budgetary needs seem more urgent. The agency insists it will "achieve audit readiness" by 2017.</p>

		<h3>Anatomy of a Budget Buster</h3>

		</section>
		<p>In the early 2000s, the Pentagon began developing a new generation of stealthy, high-tech fighter jets that were supposed to do everything from landing on aircraft carriers and taking off vertically to dogfighting and dropping bombs. The result is the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, whose three models (one each for the Navy, Air Force, and Marines) are years behind schedule, hugely over budget, and plagued with problems that have earned them a reputation as the biggest defense boondoggle in history.</p>

		<h3>Ways to Save a Few Billion</h3>
		<p>There are savings to be had within the Pentagon's massive budget—if politicians can weather the storm that kicks up whenever a pet project is targeted. Here are 10 ideas for major cuts from an array of defense wonks, from the libertarian Cato Institute and the liberal Center for American Progress to the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
